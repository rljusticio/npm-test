/*

First, create a file called `test.js`.  It doesn't have to do anything,
really.  (This is npm class, not testing class.)  But it has to exit
without throwing an error, or else the test fails.

Then, edit your `package.json` file to make your scripts section look like
this instead:

  "scripts": {
    "test": "node test.js"
  }

*/
console.log('Yup, this is the test. It probably passed or something.');
