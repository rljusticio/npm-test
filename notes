-one of the most important things npm does is install packages

-npm is best when you can be a part of it
  -this starts with making an account

-To see who you're logged in as, run `npm whoami`
-To create your account, run `npm adduser`

-npm helps us build projects
  -but for npm to be able to do that, we need to tell npm a little bit about our project
  -we can tell npm about our project in a package.json file

  -npm init --scope=<username>
    -this will create a package.json file

  -The convention is to have a single git repo for each module or project
    -Use the `git init` command to set up our working directory as a git project

  -The first thing that most people do with npm is install a dependency.
    -Dependencies are fetched from the registry, and unpacked in the `node_modules` folder.
    -To install a module, use the `npm install <modulename>` command.

  -npm isn't just for installing stuff.  It also shows you what you have installed.
    -we can do this using the `npm ls` command
      -our dependencies should be listed in the package.json file in an object called 'dependencies'
        -when we install packages, we must update the package.json file to list out this dependency
          -if we don't, an error shows up as 'extraneous', warning us that we have something there that
          we haven't listed as a dependency.

          -use the `--save` flag when installing dependencies.
            -You might not want to do this with things that you're just trying out
            -when you decide on something you can use this flag to update your package.json file easily

  -look at the package.json file, it has this rather odd bit in it:

    "scripts": {
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    }

    -npm can be used as a task runner
      -almost every module and project will have a test script that runs to make sure everything is good.
        -in order to help remind you to do this, npm puts a "always failing" test in there by default

-Before we can share this code with the world, we need to make it a bit more polished so that people know how to use it.
  -be sure to add readme, description, and repository fields

-it's very easy for all npm users to publish their modules and share them with the world.
  -packages get into the registry by using the `npm publish` command
