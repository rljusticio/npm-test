-one of the most important things npm does is install packages

-npm is best when you can be a part of it
  -this starts with making an account

-To see who you're logged in as, run `npm whoami`
-To create your account, run `npm adduser`

-npm helps us build projects
  -but for npm to be able to do that, we need to tell npm a little bit about your project
  -we can tell npm about our project in a package.json file

  -npm init --scope=<username>
    -this will create a package.json file
